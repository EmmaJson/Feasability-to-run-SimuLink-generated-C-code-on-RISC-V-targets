# Feasability-to-run-SimuLink-generated-C-code-on-RISC-V-targets
This thesis investigates the feasibility of executing C code generated by Simulinks Embedded Coder on microcontrollers built on the RISC-V architecture. The study is motivated by the fact that RISC-V provides an open, royalty-free instruction set, whereas Simulink currently offers no official RISC-V support. The primary objective was to identify the hardware and software prerequisites for a complete execution toolchain and to demonstrate a working solution. Three Simulink models, a pass-through, a FIR-based low-pass filter, and an IIR-based low-pass filter were developed and converted to fixed-point before code generation. A custom Board Support Package (BSP) was created for a 32-bit microcontroller to provide GPIO, interrupt, timing, ADC and DAC. Following integration of the BSP into the generated code, an oscilloscope is used to observe the filter's effect on a simulated heart rate. The measurements confirmed that the filters performed correct real-time signal processing and that execution remained deterministic. The results show that Simulink-based model development can indeed be combined with RISC-V hardware, although the workflow still relies on manual tasks such as fixed-point tuning and BSP-development. The study concludes that the method is technically viable and can reduce dependence on proprietary hardware, but additional work is required to create generic Hardware Support Packages in order to automate I/O interfacing.
